	/// The highest priority is node configuration.

	///  
	/// For example:  // Notice that in fact the data structure is not "tree", but is "forest".

	///         name: 'nodeA',

	///     {...}, // configurations of the next level
	///     ...
	/// ]  
	/// The Rules about Visual Mapping  
	/// When designing a treemap, we primarily focus on how to visually distinguish "different levels", "different categories in the same level", which requires appropriate settings of "rectangular color", "border thickness", "border color" and even "color saturation of rectangular" and so on on each level.
	///  
	/// See example .
	/// The top level is divided into several parts by colors "red", "green", "blue", and etc ...
	/// In each color block, colorSaturation is used to distinguish nodes in sublevel.
	/// The border color of the top level is "white", while the border color of the sublevel is the color that based on the current block color and processed by borderColorSaturation .
	///  
	/// treemap uses this rule of visual configuration: each level computes its visual value based on the configurations ( color , colorSaturation , borderColor , borderColorSaturation ) on this level.
	/// If there is no certain configuration in a node, it inherits the configuration from its parent.
	///  
	/// In this way, this effect can be configured: set a color list on the parent level, and set colorSaturation on the child level, and then each node in the parent level would obtain a color from the color list, and each node in the child level would obtain a value from colorSaturation and compound it with the color inherited from its parent node to get its final color.
	///  
	/// Dimensions and "Extra Visual Mapping"  
	/// See the example below: every value field is set as an Array, in which each item in the array represents a dimension respectively.
	///  [
	///     {
	///         value: [434, 6969, 8382],
	///         children: [
	///             {
	///                 value: [1212, 4943, 5453],
	///                 id: 'someid-1',
	///                 name: 'description of this node',
	///                 children: [...]
	///             },
	///             {
	///                 value: [4545, 192, 439],

	/// treemap will map the first dimension (the first item of the array) to "area".
	/// If we want to express more information, we could map another dimension (specified by series-treemap.visualDimension ) to another visual types, such as colorSaturation and so on.
	/// See the example and select the legend 'Growth'.
	///  
	/// How to avoid confusion by setting border/gap of node  
	/// If all of the border/gaps are set with the same color, confusion might occur when rectangulars in different levels display at the same time.
	///  
	/// See the example .
	/// Notice that the child rectangles in the red area are in the deeper level than rectangles that are saparated by white gap.
